## **Government grant for casting of roof slabs and purchase of building materials**

It is worth mentioning that in Mauritius almost 89% of the population is owner of a residential property, be it a housing unit or a residential plot of land. Hence, Government encourages self-help construction of housing units to low income families who already own a plot of land and are having difficulties to construct a concrete housing unit. These families are financially assisted through a grant scheme either for the casting of roof slabs to complete their construction or for the purchase of building materials to start their construction.

As from July 2019, the income eligibility criteria for roof slab grant and purchase of building materials have been reviewed as follows:

| **Existing Housing Schemes** | **Household Income Eligibility** | **Amount** | **Remarks** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Roof Slab Grant / Purchase of Building Materials | ≤ Rs 10,000 | Maximum one-off cash grant of Rs 100,000 | (i) Households who own a plot of land but cannot afford to complete construction of their house which has reached up to the beam level. The grant is for the casting of roof slab for an area of up to 100 m². Allowable building plan area may reach up to 150 m². |
|  |  |  | (ii) Households who own a plot of land but cannot afford to start construction of a housing unit of up to 100 m². The grant is for purchase of building materials to start construction. |
|  | > Rs 10,000 - ≤ Rs 15,000 | Maximum one-off cash grant of Rs 70,000 | Same conditions as above. |
|  | > Rs 15,000 - ≤ Rs 20,000 | Maximum one-off cash grant of Rs 50,000 | Same conditions as above. |
